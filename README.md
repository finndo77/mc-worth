Please note this is a work in progress, as I complete the revamp of the list prices I will do a "release", when I finish adding the 1.16 items, I will do a "release", when I finish adding the 1.17 items, I will do a "release", and so on.  Please note my intent is to post this page on Reddit r/admincraft after performing the initial "release".

create issues for requested updates please

comments welcome

The point of this repo is to retain a publicly available listibng of values for in game minecraft items, usable by plugins and mods for Economy systems in Minecraft.


1. I do not intend on making items insanely high priced
1. I do intend to build crafted item prices based on the sum of their parts
1. I do not like weird dollar amounts, 0.25, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75 or whole numbers are as far as I'll go, when pricing if you need to change the value after a decimal, round up to the the next value in the preceeding list.
1. The base of this list is someone else's 1.15 list I borrowed 2 years ago and do not have the name of the original owner, I found it on reddit, it has lots of bad values, I have not fixed all of them. (example I just noticed, birch log = 10, birch plank = 3.3, birch slab = 1.3, stick = 0.5, and a wooden shovel = 2.0... definitely needs fixing)
1. I am starting with this list as I have already added a little over half of the 1.16 items
1. The list is alphabetically sorted, yes categories would be nice; however as minecraft seems to have been adjusting item names over the last year and some change, keeping it alphabetical keeps most of the related items together anyway, and makes it easier to find a single item without guessing how someone else decided to categorize it (besides searching ;)
